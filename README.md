and players to store and access campaign-related information securely.


This application allows users to:

Create and manage campaigns
Create and manage characters, connecting a link to their D&D Beyond Character Sheet

Access data based on their assigned role
Authentication is required to access protected pages, and data is filtered so users only see information associated with their account.
